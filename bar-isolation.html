      <h1>Isolating the Bar</h1>
      <p>
       An experiment was carried out to better understand the difference between the sound
       created by the vibraphone mallet and the bar. The goal for this experiment is to
       determine if it is possible to isolate the resonant portion of a sound in order to
       compare it with our simulated sound. The following outlines the experiment background,
       procedure, and results.
      </p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
       The following is a recording of a vibraphone playing a B4:
      </p>
      <audio controls>
       <source src="./res/vibraphone-full.wav" type="audio/wav">
      </audio>
      <p>
      The following is the same recording with the first 100ms trimmed off:
      </p>
      <audio controls>
       <source src="./res/vibraphone-no-impact.wav" type="audio/wav">
      </audio>

      <p>
       This experiment compares the harmonic spectrums of these tones. The initial loud impact
       of the bar brings out some of the brighter overtones during the first fraction of a
       second. Additionally, and perhaps more noticeably, the sound of the mallet or stick
       greatly influences the perceived timbre.
      </p>

      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <p>
       The following tools and inputs are required for this experiment:
       <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity">Audaciy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freesound.org/people/Komponist/sounds/33188/">A Vibraphone Note Recording</a></li>
       </ul>

       The first step is to create a new sound file that is the original with the first fraction
       of a second clipped off.
      </p>

      <p>
       <b>Open the sound file in Audacity:</b>
       <p><img src="./res/open-sound.gif" style="width: 400px;"></img></p>
      </p>
      <p>

       <b>Select the first 0.1 seconds of the track and hit the delete key:</b>
       <p><img src="./res/trim-sound.gif" style="width: 400px;"></img></p>
       <i>Note: hold “CTRL” and scroll to zoom in or out</i>
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the two sound files, the harmonic spectrums can be derived using Audacity. The
       steps are as follows:

       <ol>
        <li> Open the file in Audacity </li>
        <li> Select all audio in the track by double clicking it</li>
        <li> In the menu, select Analyze > Plot Spectrum</li>
       </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
       With some simple bitmap editing tools, the two plots can be easily compared. The
       following image shows a comparison of the two audio files. The purple represents the
       spectrum of the original sound. The green represents the spectrum of the trimmed sound:
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       From this graph, we can very easily see the harmonic series. The fundamental tone is
       visible around 500 hz. Overtones are visible around 1000 hz, 1500 hz, 2000 hz, and
       2500 hz. These five overtones appear to be approximately harmonic. The trimmed
       sound clip will be a great approximation for the required isolated resonance that will
       be compared against the final simulated sound.
